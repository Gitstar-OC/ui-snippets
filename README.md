## For HighSeas 

I have forked this project and add the tailwind CSS section to it which did not exist before. You can check the difference in between both of the app by visiting the below two links.

## More on this project

I hope you all love this project, this was created with Nextjs version 11 and with page router so it took a little bit of time for me to set it up. You can fork, edit, contribute and pull issues.

**Happy Coding**
